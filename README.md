# *Channel: Death* Design and Process Documentation

![banner](Documentation/Images/channelDeathTopBanner.png)

This is the documentation repository for the game *Channel: Death*. It uses the Method for Design Materialization (MDM) approach for documenting game design research-creation ([gamesasresearch.com](https://www.gamesasresearch.com)).

## Download the game: [nightcity.itch.io/channel-death](https://nightcity.itch.io/channel-death)

The production repository lives privately elsewhere. The game was originally created for a two week game jam and I did not have the foresight to prepare the repository for sharing publicly (that is, to configure the ignore list to screen any source materials we might not have permission to distribute publicly).
