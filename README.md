# *Channel: Death* Design and Process Documentation

![banner](Documentation/Images/channelDeathTopBanner.png)

This is the documentation repository for the game *Channel: Death*. It uses the Method for Design Materialization (MDM) approach for documenting game design research-creation ([gamesasresearch.com](https://www.gamesasresearch.com)).

The production repository lives privately elsewhere. The game was originally created for a two-week game jam and in my fervor to complete the game on time I did not have the foresight to prepare the repository for sharing publicly (that is, to configure the ignore list to screen any source materials we might not have permission to distribute publicly).

## Game Description
Channel: Death is an installation-based digital escape room where players use a vintage television remote and old-fashioned pen and paper to cooperatively solve puzzles, complete minigames, and thwart the nefarious Broadcast Killer. Designed for in-person festivals, players work together over the course of an event leaving physical notes to track clues and collaborate with successive players. The CRT TV presentation and TV remote interface synergize with the game's mechanics, narrative, and aesthetics to evoke a unique gameplay experience inspired by channel surfing in the ‘80s and ‘90s.
