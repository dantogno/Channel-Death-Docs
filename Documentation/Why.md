# Why?

## Origins

*Chanel: Death* began as a game jam game for Chicaghoul 2023. This created three original constraints that originally guided the design of the project:

1. Must be horror or Halloween themed.
2. Must be completed in two weeks.
3. Project will be exhibited at an in-person event.

The idea of doing a game with a TV remote as the controller was proposed by Ian, and it immediately resonated with me as a great solution to items #1 and #3 above.

## TV remote as game control interface

From my perspective as a millennial, the TV remote is a common interface well known by an audience broader than "gamers," and less intimidating interfaces are important for convincing unacquainted audiences at an event to participate in a game experience.

However, perhaps the TV remote's era of cultural dominance has crested and begun to recede as younger generations grow up with entertainment linked more closely to the internet. We typically navigate internet media with touch screens and keyboard and mouse interfaces. Remotes are still common for streaming TV shows and movies on television sets connected to the internet, but the methods for navigating shows have shifted from channel surfing to text-based search and algorithmic suggestions.

This frames some questions the work seeks to answer:

- How will audiences react to and interact with a TV remote as a game interface?

- What does a game with a TV remote interface look like, and how does it work, both technically and from aesthetic and design perspectives?

## TV as a game design aesthetic

We did not want to simply make a typical game that was controlled with the unusual (for games) interface of the TV remote. We wanted to make a game that felt like watching TV. That TV is passive, while games are interactive, presented a core design challenge.

- What game design can exist within the tension between the passive medium of TV and the interactive medium of games?

- What are the affordances of TV and how do they work as or within a game?

## Asynchronous local collaboration

As we worked on answering the above questions, a new goal emerged, relevant to the original constraint of creating something for an in-person event.

We wanted the game to:

- Allow audience members / event attendees to asynchronously yet collaboratively participate.

- Facilitate shorter play sessions for individual players, but persist across a longer event duration.

- Interest spectators, including as an ambient experience.

## Incorporating physical media and extra-game elements

As another tactic for spectacle and immersion, we wanted to create connections between digital gameplay and the physical world.

## Horror

This is a Halloween game, after all. There are synergies between TV and horror, and many games have evoked 80s and 90s VHS horror aesthetics. We wanted to harness these synergies by incorporating gore, cameras and voyeurism, night and darkness, analog broadcast artifacts, references to popular horror cinema, and more.
