  ClueBank:
  - They kept saying something about 'red' being the first color of the rainbow.
  - I woke up in a room full of roses.
  - They kept muttering about someone named Scarlet.
  - They wouldn't stop playing some weird music they called "King Crimson."
  - They kept talking about Pokemon Ruby?
  - I found a note that says "Sanguine, or red chalk, is a chalk of reddish-browrn
    color, so called because it resembles the color of dried blood."
  - When I woke up, I found a drawing of three cherries in my pocket.
  - They said the only way to produce the color carmine was by crushing insects.
    So gross!
